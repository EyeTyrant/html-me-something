            Rented a Jeep for the week, seemed almost like a necessity for exploring the narrow mountainous roads on the
            island.

            After a recommended stop at Pizza Amore (best pizza around) for a late lunch, we headed to our first night
            rental right next to the Charlotte Amalee Overlook. What a gorgeous view from our balcony.

            On the second day, we checked in to our villa at Marriott Frenchman's Cove Resort for the rest of our stay.

            The beach was nice, we saw a couple of sting rays while snorkeling, but the rocks at the water's edge were
            full of urchins.

            Tuesday evening brought Tropical Storm Karen in our direction at sunset. Wednesday was a little windy with
            occasional showers. The water was too rough to go swimming so we hung out under umbrellas at the pool.
